    <h2> About Ejeme</h2>

<hr />

    <p><img src="C:\Users\tomij\ejemes_bootcamp\Basic-Portfolio\assets\images\mide.png" width="200px"/> My name is Ejeme. I am a full-stack web developer who loves physics and math. I actually graduated as a Doctor of Optometry from the University of Benin, but my love is much bigger than staring into peoples’ eyes all day. I think I prefer to deal with numbers, which I’m pretty good at. When I’m not coding, I love spending time cooking, working out, or just hanging out with my three boys.</p>

    <p>I have also had the opportunity to be an entrepreneur, which was very awesome. I started a plastics recycling plant in Lagos, Nigeria with a goal to reduce the amount of waste that made its way into the ecosystem without being recycled properly. It was quite awesome turning waste material into raw material for further plastics production. I sold the business for a handsome fee when I had ramped up sales and started turning a profit.</p>

    <p>Now I’m ready for my next conquest. I’m ready to work on your next project and deliver superior quality deliverables that will also ramp up your sales and improve your productivity.</p>
